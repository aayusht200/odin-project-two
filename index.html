                    From cozy corners with ambient lighting to fast-paced espresso bars, I explored a variety of coffee
                    spots across the city.
                    Here's a quick rundown of what I tasted, saw, and loved — and what you should try if you’re ever in
                    town.

                    <p>A calm, sunlit space with Greek-French inspired minimalist decor and a relaxed work-friendly
                        vibe.
                        The vanilla latte was smooth, earthy, and well-balanced.
                        Great for spending an entire day — don’t miss the famous tiramisu latte.</p>

                        Modern, minimal interior near Times Square with lots of foot traffic and limited space to work.
                        The vanilla latte was creamy and chocolaty; the strawberry cream latte was like dessert in a
                        cup.
                        Best for grab-and-go — their matcha drinks are also worth a try. </p>

                        Futuristic Japanese café design with no tables and a fast-paced, office-heavy crowd.
                        The iced Kyoto latte was sweet and smooth, while the vanilla latte was balanced and creamy.
                        Try the espresso tonic — a surprisingly refreshing and unique drink.

                        A hip, gray-toned café from China with a quirky vibe and limited seating near Bryant Park.
                        The iced orange americano was bold and unusual, while their patented aerofoam coffee was creamy
                        and
                        evolving.
                        Great specialty drinks — pair them with their delicious butter toast.
